                    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this semester, I
                        have been assigned to create a webpage that use only HTML. And I am very new to HTML and web
                        technology.
                        So, I have to study each HTML element to create this webpage. First of all, my instuctor
                        recommned w3schools to be a place to study. After I study some HTML elements, I try to create
                        my first webpage, but it end up very terrible. I learn that I should design my webpage
                        before doing HTML. So, I design my webpage to be black-white and set all content in left due
                        to the limitation of the assignment. Then, I do a reserch about what should have in a portfolio
                        webpage.
                        I got an answer about skill, interesting, education, story about myself, and contact
                        information. And one important thing is purpose of the webpage. So, my webpage purpose is to represent myself in professional way.
                        After that, I start to create my webpage again. At the beginning, I use table tag to arrange
                        element in my webpage.
                        It has no problem until I want to have 2 paragraph in my webpage. My second paragraph did not
                        place in order from the previous table.
                        So, I decide to redesign my webpage content to be at the center. I start create my webpage
                        again. At the beginning, I use center tag to cover all elements to center everything.
                        Then I put my information into the webpage and link to SIT website. I go to w3schools to learn
                        how to use a tag.
                        In paragraph about myself, I use p tag inside table to arrange paragraph to be align left. So,
                        the table will be in the middle and paragraph inside will align left. If I not do this, the
                        text inside
                        paragraph will align center and it will be hard to read. After that, I decide to give information about my 
                        my education by nesting unorder list inside table. About my skill and work experience, I also use same technique as I use with education.
                        When it came to "my contact" part, I decide to put a button that can mail to me. When user click the button, It will open Email application and set the receiver to 
                        wicharn.keisei@gmail.com. Next part is my social, I also use table to arrange element in this part. I also use social media icon as a link to my social media by using a tag.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I learn a lot of knowledge by doing HTML only webpage, such as purpose of webpage, structure 
                        of webpage, frequent used elements, designing webpage and easy pattern of webpage. It is a great experience doing this assignment.
