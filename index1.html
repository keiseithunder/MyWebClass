        <h3>My journal about HTML only webpage</h3>
        <table width="750">
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this semester, I
                        have been assigned to create a webpage that use only HTML. And I am very new to HTML and web
                        technology.
                        So, I have to study each HTML element to create this webpage. First of all, my instuctor
                        recommned w3schools to be a place to study. After I study some HTML elements, I try to create
                        my first webpage, but it end up very terrible. I learn that I should design my webpage
                        before doing HTML. So, I design my webpage to be black-white and set all content in left due
                        to the limitation of the assignment. Then, I do a reserch about what should have in a portfolio
                        webpage.
                        I got an answer about skill, interesting, education, story about myself, and contact
                        information.
                        After that, I start to create my webpage again. At the beginning, I use table tag to arrange
                        element in my webpage.
                        It has no problem until I want to have 2 paragraph in my webpage. My second paragraph did not
                        place in order from the previous table.
                        So, I decide to redesign my webpage content to be at the center. I start create my webpage
                        again. At the beginning, I use center tag to cover all elements to center everything.
                        Then I put my information into the webpage and link to SIT website. I go to w3schools to learn
                        how to use a tag.
                        In paragraph about myself, I use p tag inside table to arrange paragraph to be align left. So,
                        the table will be in the middle and paragraph inside will align left. If I not do this, the text inside
                        paragraph will align center and it will hard to read.
